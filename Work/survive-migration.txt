Like a zombie apocalypse, a CMS migration tests your adaptability under severe stress. The long hours, the multi-team collaboration, and the constant changes leave you feeling less than alive. Here are some tips to prevent the zombie transformation.
<h2>Prep Yourself</h2>
The hardest part to accept will be the constant changes, from updating priorities to dynamic builds. Allow yourself to be flexible. Understand that things will change and are beyond your control. This mentality allows you to prepare for when they do.

<p>Remember that the entire team is delving into the unknown, so it's better to dive in together. Clear communication prevents future headaches. An effective way to  communicate during a CMS migration is by using a project management tool. Google Docs' variety of products allow for documentation, bug tracking, and progress tracking all in one place. Google Docs collaborative nature enables anyone to reprioritize, add, and/or comment on edits. Alternatives are Asana and Trello. The use of collaborative platforms ensure teams and teammates know current progress on migration-related items.</p>
<h2><b>Plan the Attack</b></h2>
<p>Before diving into the CMS, plan a method of attack. Decide roles, tracking methods, timetables, and priorities. Priorities diversify in size,  ranging from all mobile styes to pixel-perfect details.</p>

<p>Next, familiarize yourself with the CMS. Know what every button and component does. Understand the interface. Be sure to follow one rule through this process: document everything. Document your process and any difficulties you encounter along the way. Document any unique approaches you took. This way, you can refer back to any discoveries you made during the migration.</p>
<h2>Gather Resources</h2>
At this point, outline what resources you and your team needs. By gathering your resources before starting any work, you create a more efficient workflow. Develop the folder system for both HTML files and assets. Decide what templates you need and the proper way to build them, component-wise. Update the documentation throughout this process with any progressions, including naming conventions, component jargon, or specialized builds.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
A migration, much like a zombie infection, pushes you to your limits. Be flexible and willing to adapt to an ever-changing environment. Realize that a migration is a team effort. No one ever survived an apocalypse alone.
