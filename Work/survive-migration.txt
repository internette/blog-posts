Like a zombie apocalypse, a CMS migration tests your adaptability under severe stress. The long hours, the multi-team collaboration, and the constant changes leave you feeling less than alive. Here are some tips to prevent the zombie transformation.
<h2>Prep Yourself</h2>
The most difficult part of any migration (or zombie attack) will be adapting to constant changes, from updating priorities to dynamic builds. Allow yourself to be flexible. Understand that priorities will shift and that some things are beyond your control. Going in with this mentality will save you and your team from unnecessary angst in the long run.

<p>Clear team communication is also key in preventing future headaches. Make sure you have a project management and tracking system in place that everyone knows how to use - this can be done in Google Docs/Sheets (free), or using tools like Basecamp, Trello or Asana (subscription-based). </p>
<p>Here’s an example of a Google Sheet template our team used in a recent migration project:</p>
<p>The use of collaborative platforms ensure teammates are aware of the current progress on migration-related items.</p>
<h2>Plan the Attack</h2>
<p>Before diving into new the CMS, plan a method of attack. Decide team roles, tracking methods  (see the project management tips above), and milestones/deadlines. </p>
<p>Next, familiarize yourself with the CMS. Know what every button and component does. Understand the interface. Be sure to follow one rule through this process: document everything. Document your process and any difficulties you encounter along the way. Document any unique approaches you took. This way, you can refer back to any discoveries you made during the migration.</p>
<h2>Gather Resources</h2>
At this point, outline what resources you and your team needs. By gathering your resources before starting any work, you create a more efficient workflow. Develop the folder system for both HTML files and assets. Decide what templates you need and the proper way to build them, component-wise. Update the documentation throughout this process with any progressions, including naming conventions, component jargon, or specialized builds.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
A migration, much like a zombie infection, pushes you to your limits. Be flexible and willing to adapt to an ever-changing environment. Realize that a migration is a team effort. No one ever survived an apocalypse alone.
