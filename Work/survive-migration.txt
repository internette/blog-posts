<p>Like a zombie apocalypse, a CMS migration tests your adaptability under severe stress. The long hours, the multi-team collaboration, and the constant changes leave you feeling less than alive. Here are some tips to prevent the zombie transformation.</p>
<h2>Prep Yourself</h2>
The most difficult part of any migration (or zombie attack) will be adapting to constant changes, from updating priorities to dynamic builds. Allow yourself to be flexible. Understand that priorities will shift and that some things are beyond your control. Going in with this mentality will save you and your team from unnecessary angst in the long run.
<p>Clear team communication is also key in preventing future headaches. Make sure you have a project management and tracking system in place that everyone knows how to use - this can be done in Google Docs/Sheets (free), or using tools like Basecamp, Trello or Asana (subscription-based). </p>
<p>Here’s an example of a Google Sheet template our team used in a recent migration project:</p>

<p>The use of collaborative platforms ensure teammates are aware of the current progress on migration-related items.</p>
<h2>Plan the Attack</h2>
<p>Before diving into new the CMS, plan a method of attack. Decide team roles, tracking methods  (see the project management tips above), and milestones/deadlines. </p>
<p>Next, familiarize yourself with the CMS. Know what every button and component does. Understand the interface. Be sure to follow one rule through this process: document everything. Document your process and any difficulties you encounter along the way. Document any unique approaches you took. This way, you can refer back to any discoveries you made during the migration.</p>
<h2>Gather Resources</h2>
<p>At this point, outline what resources you and your team needs. By gathering your resources before starting any work, you create a more efficient workflow. Develop the folder system for both HTML files and assets. Decide what templates you need and the proper way to build them, component-wise. Update the documentation throughout this process with any progressions, including naming conventions, component jargon, or specialized builds.</p>
<h2>Attack!</h2>
<p>The hour arrives. Time to tackle this migration. Throughout the migration, your trackers will be your map. Start with a page that’s light on content and features. This eases any chance of being overwhelmed. Divide the page into evenly-weighted sections, reevaluating each section weight as needed. A section with three paragraphs may weigh as much as a section with two paragraphs, an image, and a call-to-action button. While going through the page, spend no more than fifteen minutes per section and note any problems that take longer in the tracker. This method will allow you to get more work done faster. You can come back to listed problems at the completion of a page or pass them off to a teammate.</p>
<p>When choosing which page to create next, aim for one that’s slightly harder that the last. Hold off on custom pages until you have a few completed regulars under your belt. This way, you have a much broader arsenal of skills and shortcuts to work with when that time comes. </p>
<p>Maintain contact with your team as you conquer the horde. Share tips and tricks you’ve discovered along the way. Inform each other of known bugs. Always check your tracker for priority updates. Contact improves efficiency, efficiency improves workflow, and improved workflow increases completed content amount.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A migration, much like a zombie infection, pushes you to your limits. Be flexible and willing to adapt to an ever-changing environment. Realize that a migration is a team effort. No one ever survived an apocalypse alone.</p>
