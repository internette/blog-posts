The fast-moving, client-driven technilogical world lacks a safe place for designers and developers to voice their opinions. We're told to leave our feelings and opinions at the door, leaving the creative process uninspired. When finally given the chance to defend creative decisions, the inability to prepare takes us by surprise and we wind up coming off as defensive, leaving a bitter taste in the audience's mouth. In this article, I'll explain the difference between defending and defensive and explain ways to avoid being the latter.
In the professional world, defending and defensive differ greatly. We define "defending" as giving reason to your choices objectively. In client work, defending a choice includes stats and facts that back up your explanation. When critiquing front-end code, defending your work includes facts related to browser performance, browser support, verified web trends, experimental technology, and potential build time, to name a few. Design defenses may include anything from print costs to color trends and color schemes (analogous colors, complementary colors, etcetera), with potential to bring in the principles and elements of design. These approaches provide explanation while treating the client with respect. While you may have to explain some of these things to the client, using these concepts to explain your choices enable you to appear knowledgable about what you’re talking about. This aids the client see through your eyes, potentially swaying the client in your favor.
You'll know that you're focusing more on your opinion and less on the project when you starting using first person, including “I”, “me”, and “my”. This slippery approach increases the chance of appearing defensive, which is either defending yourself when defensive measures aren’t necessary or when opinionating your reasoning. While “This blue is too blue” may seem to be a valid point, this approach comes off as defensive when there are no facts or other than opinions as justification. While you may feel justified in your response, if there aren’t facts yet you continue to explain your choice, you’re probably being defensive, similar to the saying “beating a dead horse”.

So how do you avoid appearing defensive when dealing with a client? Here are a few tips:

First rule: If you walk in with the mentality that you're “dealing” with a client, you're going to walk into the meeting with a defensive mindset.
Second rule: The client is rarely wrong, especially when starting out in the field. I know that there’s much debate about this. A few examples of when a client may be wrong: what constitutes as reasonable timelines, what browsers can and cannot do, what can be accomplished with print, and costs. To avoid becoming defensive, I follow the rule “The client isn’t wrong, they’re just wrong for you”.
Third rule: Walk in with either printouts or notes of facts and stats that may relate to your job to support your claims. These may include browser usage stats, browser compatibility stats, etcetera. By bringing such papers and/or notes, you can stay on track and avoid being defensive.
Fourth rule: If you can’t stay objective about a subject, tell the client you will get back to them on that point by EOB (End of Business). This gives you time to collect your thoughts and prepare for possible backlash or continuation of the topic beyond the initial question.
Fifth rule: Ask the question “Is what I’m about to say really necessary?”. By asking this, you avoid unnecessary comments or possible backlash that may lead to defensive behavior.
